## Flappy Bird Bot

* Use reinforcement learning: Q-learning to solve the **flappy bird game**
* Achieve highest score of 13000 points and average score of 3000 points



### Requirement:

1. [flappy_bird_gym](https://github.com/Talendar/flappy-bird-gym)
2. json



### Files Clarification:

1. `gainIter.npy` -- Record the average score after training for certain amount of iterations, `gainIter.npy` is only used for plotting **training tendency** for project report
2. `Q.json` -- Record the scores of  `flap` and `doNothing` action at each state. When one of the score of the action is higher than the other, perform that action. `Q.json` is generated by the training script`new_qlearn.py`

1. `new_qlearn.py` -- Train the agent to play flappy bird

2. `Q_agents_simulation.py` -- Once Complete the training, use `Q_agents_simulation.py` to let the agent play the game by using generated `Q.json`. One can change the criteria of the result to get desired simulation

   > Eg. highest score, any score > 1000

3. **`/modified_flappy_bird_gym`** -- To make the  `Q_agents_simulation.py` work. Find the location of your own `/flappy_bird_gym`, and overwrite the whole folder with `/modified_flappy_bird_gym`

   * Add two new environments:  `flappy_bird_env_simple_cust.py` and `flappy_bird_env_simple_replay.py`
   * Add two new game logic: `game_logic_record.py` and `game_logic_replay.py`
   * `/modified_flappy_bird_gym` **only serves for the job of recording and replaying** for `Q_agents_simulation.py`, which **has no effect on training process**



### How to run this project?

1. Install necessary module:
2. Overwrite `/flappy_bird_gym` with `/modified_flappy_bird_gym`, but not changing the folder name
3. (Optional)Run new_qlearn.py (**could take up to 10 hours**)
4. After getting `Q.json`, run `Q_agents_simulation.py`
